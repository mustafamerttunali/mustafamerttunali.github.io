<!-- My research is in deep learning for medical image analysis, advised by <a href="https://www.hassanpourlab.com/" style="color:navy" target="_blank">Saeed Hassanpour</a>. More specifically, I work on visual analysis of histopathology images and enjoy solving problems using small data. I occasionally do natural language processing. -->
