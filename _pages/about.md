I am a second-year PhD student at Ghent University of Belgium, working on the topic of adversarial examples and model interpretability in deep learning. My most recent works include (1) adversarial attacks on segmentation models and (2) plausable defenses against adversarial examples. I graduated from MSc. Data Science in University of Southampton (UK) in 2017 and BSc. Computer Engineering in Yasar University (Turkey) in 2014. In between MSc. and BSc. I worked as an SAP Business Intelligence Consultant for two years, visiting various companies and solving their BI needs.

In terms of research, I am generally interested in:

* Adversarial examples (properties, attacks, and defenses)
* Real-world applications (attacks) of adversarial examples 
* Deep learning model interpretability
* Out-of-distribution detection
