## Computer Vision and Deep Learning | AI in Healthcare


Welcome, My name is Mert.


I like solving problems and understanding how things work. I have been working in the field of computer vision for about 4 years. My vision is to develop innovative technologies with using AI in healthcare.I'm interested at analysing medical images using computer vision and deep learning techniques.

I used to work on autonomous cars/robots, however, when I had cancer (lymphoma), I have started to interest at healthcare - medical imaging. My vision has changed after I defeated the cancer. My vision is to develop  innovative technologies with using AI in healthcare. 

I believe that AI in healthcare will increase the ability for healthcare professionals to better understand the day-to-day patterns and needs of the people they care for, and with that understanding they are able to provide better feedback, guidance and support for staying healthy.

In the words of Stephen Hawking:
> Science is beautiful when it makes simple explanations of phenomena or connections between different observations. Examples include the double helix in biology and the fundamental equations of physics.
