## Software Developer | Computer Vision and Deep Learning | Medical Imaging | AI in Healthcare


Hi. My name is Mert. I'm interested at computer vision, deep learning, medical imaging and neuroscience. I used to work on autonomous cars/robots, however, when I had a cancer (lymphoma), I have started to work on healthcare - medical imaging. 

I have developed brain tumor (hgg) detection and segmentation using deep learning techniques with less data. My vision has changed after I defeated the cancer. My vision is to develop  innovative technologies with using AI in healthcare. 

Now, I'm developing Deep Learning based GUI which you can train your model with no detailed configuration needed! Set your labeled dataset and start the training right away and monitor it with TensorBoard or DLTGUI tool.

In the words of Stephen Hawking:
> Science is beautiful when it makes simple explanations of phenomena or connections between different observations. Examples include the double helix in biology and the fundamental equations of physics.

### Yesil Science (2019 Sep - 2019 Dec)
* Developed FluAI Segmentation Version.
* Optimized and deployed deep learning models on Amazon Web Services (AWS EC2).
* Built a machine learning models that can predict oral, dental and brain health status.
* Worked on different 11 health modules such as oral and dental, brain and kidney.

*-Garanti Partners*

### NextHorizons (2017 Jun - 2019 Feb)
Since 2017, I have been developing computer vision and deep learning algorithms. I worked in Next Horizons as software developer. Worked on artificial intelligence and software development for robotic platforms. Developed many critical parts of the software including:
* Lane Detection,
* Pedestrian and Soldier Detection,
* Squad Leader Following and Obstacle Avoidance,
* Human and Forklift Detection in factory for safety,
* 2D and 3D Mapping Indoor,
* Setting and optimizing DualShock4 to use robot.
